# Sample Images Directory

Place your voting option images in this directory with the following names:
- option1.jpg
- option2.jpg
- option3.jpg

Make sure the images are:
- High quality
- Appropriate aspect ratio (recommended: 16:9 or 4:3)
- Optimized for web use
- Relevant to your voting options

You can replace these image names in the `src/app/vote/page.tsx` file if you want to use different filenames.
